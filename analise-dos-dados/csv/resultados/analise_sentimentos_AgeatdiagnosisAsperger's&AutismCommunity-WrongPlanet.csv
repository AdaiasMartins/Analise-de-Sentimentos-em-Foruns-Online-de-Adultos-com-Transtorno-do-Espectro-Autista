King Kat 1,Male,"I didn't take the poll as I don't have an official diagnosis as of now, but it was pointed out to me by an EX that I might be, then my Aunt soon after, who was a pre-school teacher, had a kid in her class who had ASD and that he reminded her of me when I was growing up. With my EX, we first started dating and I was trying to put on my best face at first and then well, by the 3rd date the truth showed it's ugly head. It did start making sense, the stupid things I had done and said, no eye contact, needing a set schedule and being uptight, odd interests, eccentric, a bit of a geek and generally my own odd mannerisms, which why I was HATED in school. So, this answered questions about the past and while I still feel embarrassed along with s--ty about the thing, I came to realize this was not 100% all my fault. I was 24 at the time but it took me a long time to get past the denial phase, which was like 5 years later.

I'd like to see a few more age brackets at the top end of the poll.If OP Catster is 44 now then she was approaching 30 when she started this topic. At the time, ""30+"" probably probably seemed like it would encompass all the unbelievably ancient folk with only a few years of life left in them.
