ZombieBrideXD,Female,"I like looking back on the old interests i used to have,When i was 2, i had a special interest in making towers and piles, i would tower up the spices in my moms spice drawer and take all the clothes out of my closet every night and pile it in my door way, i would get excited if i saw anything resembling a pile or a tower (except feces lol). And then it was wearing a cat suit, i had a cat costume that i refused to take off and convinced myself i was a cat, id even eat cat food. I also really liked Tarzan and Thumbelina, they were the only movies i watched.Then in grade school, it shifted from Ghosts, to Titanic, Frogs, Remote controlled cars, walkie talkies, Beta Fishes, and Salamanders. In middle school it got more intense, when i was 10 i found this rubber stretchy Mummy halloween toy, i named it mummy dude and carried it around with me for 2- 3 years straight, when i was 12 i watched Coraline and become COMPLETELY obsessed with it for about a year, then when in september of 2009 i was introduced to Sonic... What was your FIRST special Interest?

Noca,Male,"As a kid I had collections of everything. Stamps, rocks, bottle caps, erasers, pogs, baseball cards, pens, pencils, Lego, though I am not sure which one came first. All I know is I was preoccupied with collecting things.",-0.2411
kraftiekortie,Male,"Probably the ""Wacky Races"" cartoon when I was 7. Before then, I really wasn't interested in much. I might get happy about some things, though. I was also scared of lots....including the Moon and planets. I couldn't look up at the Moon until I was a teenager.",-0.1868
TheAP,Female,"When I was about 6-7 I became interests in grammar and parenting. But I may have had special interests before that. I remember I was really into certain book series and TV shows, and also certain combinations of letters and numbers on licence plates or clocks. And of course, I was always interested in my own thoughts and imaginings.",0.9415

And then when I hit like 18, I LOVED socks, pretty sure I have some kind of sock fetish- I love socks! bright ones, short ones, long ""thigh-high"" ones, thick socks, socks with patterns, silk socks, cotton socks polyester socks, SOCKS!! !! I love them all. Socks with ""heat tech"" in them socks lined with silver, crew socks, ankle socks, running socks, compression socks, socks with 90 angles at the heel, socks over socks.... all of the socks. Minimalist socks, crazy weird socks you see on fashion runways....  My first interest when I was 5 and half was how magnets worked. I never got over that one either. : DStill love magnets!! !! However, I broadened it to science in general. I love science. I could talk about it until I go blue in the face, pass out, probably still subconsciously think about it, and then regain consciousness and then resume my discussion (or should I said mostly like my lecture/monologue) and then continue for some time onwards. god damn I love those subjects.  I also really like trains and maps of trains and train tickets from different countries. I like public transportation more generally as well. I liked the trains in Canada when I went there- they were very clean.  My special interests seem to spiral outwards and become very general and then sometimes spiral back inward, like an up down weaving in and out sort of thing. It's ... interesting to think about. : )",0.9985
