Jamesy,Male,One of my pub mates who is 67 confessed to me that's he has never had a proper girlfriend in his life. In the past the relationships with women he's had never blossomed beyond 'friendship'.Do you agree with that's qute unusual the situation my friend is in? He's missing a few teeth and is around 5ft6 but I don't think that would really matter....
babybird,Female,"He's just not met the right oneMy bf was similar in a sense that he just never met the right woman who he wanted to have a long term relationship with until he met meHe's not as old as your friend BTW but he's probably in a minority of men who have never settled down until later on in life

DuckHairback,Male,"I'd imagine it is quite unusual, yeah. I don't think I've ever known anyone of that age who didn't have some sort of romantic history, even if it wasn't much.But we don't know much about this guy do we? Apart from his missing a few teeth and being 5ft 6 which I'd consider irrelevant. Where's he been all this time? What was he doing? You should talk to him more, get some answers.

TwilightPrincess,Female,"If the man in the OP is the same one you've talked about before, it seems like his problem might be more about making women uncomfortable than his personal appearance.

WantToHaveALife,Male,"is he a virgin too? i unfortuneately not long ago, sadly came into contact with men who are 47 and 57 and claim they have never kissed a woman before, cases like this just are another angry reminder on how i'm not afraid to admit, it truly does feel unfair being a man at times, yes i know there is no such thing as fairness."

Not now though"

WantToHaveALife,Male,"reminds me, on tiktok, i know of a woman who claims to be in her early 40s and she says she has never had a boyfriend, while yes, for a while, i do believe cases like that can happen to women, me and lots of people agree that naturally those cases are male-dominated."

Jamesy,Male,I have kissed women (when younger) but never had sexMaybe I should not entirely give up hope since ladies have come up and kissed me before

WantToHaveALife,Male,"there is a late bloomer facebook group, a woman there made an anonymous post, claims she never had a BF until 38."
