TwilightPrincess,Female,"I only ghosted on a couple of occasions - when someone made me really uncomfortable. Well, it didn’t quite look like the ghosting in the video. I was visible since I chose to wear a white sheet. You know how it is.Show Spoiler

TwilightPrincess,Female,"I just avoid wearing pointy hoods/hats unless they’re black ones and, even then, only if my broom is in working order.

Carbonhalo,Male,White pointy hoods are acceptable whilst using a jetpack.
Fnord,Male,"To me, 'ghosting' someone is like boycotting their existence, and I only engage in boycotts over egregious events.

AprilR,Female,I had to ghost people a few times bc they were over the top clingy and persistent.
King Kat 1,Male,"It is, I've been ghosted myself before. IMO the ex-friend that did it to me was taking the cowards way out, because he wasn't getting what he wanted out of me anymore and I think knew I was onto his BS. He was a manipulator, a freeloader, and a major narcissist. I knew him for nearly 17 years and looking back now, I am somewhat sure he was on the spectrum. A NT can and is more likely to do said behaviors above but as I learned more about myself over the years, the ex-friends many behaviors make me think he is on the spectrum as well.I did ghost a different EX friend, who kept flaking out on me, many times at the last minute. Would never respond to messages or make up some excuse "" Oh.. I guess I'm not good about messaging back he he"" . Then when he did come around, it was while I was at work, and I told him what my work schedule was on several occasions. I found this to be disrespectful and rude, so I blocked him on social media and took his number out of my phone. Since then, I understand he's gotten really into some church he joined and is a big time Trump supporter now. No regrets cutting him loose.

nick007,Male,"I've unintentionally ghosted various friends before due to getting distracted & forgetting I had messages to read & reply to. Sometimes certain messages require me to have a bit of focus or to be using my desktop computer instead of my phone. I'm also bad at keeping certain conversations going. I've been ghosted by friends as well probably for similar reasons, or them getting busy with life, or finding me too needy & draining. I don't generally think of that as ghosting though.I've never been ghosted or done ghosting in romantic relationships. I think once a relationship gets serious people should generally tell their partners that the relationship is over. I can understand wanting to avoid confrontation but a Dear John letter could be messaged stating it's over so they're not waiting around trying to message & call worrying that something bad happened.

ezbzbfcg2,Male,"Fnord wrote:To me, 'ghosting' someone is like boycotting their existence, and I only engage in boycotts over egregious events.Then I think you fail to comprehend what ghosting is.If two people can't get along, and one says, ""That's it, I've had enough. I'm boycotting you and will never speak to you again,"" then they've made it clear that they are done with communication.Ghosting is an ABRUPT, out-of-nowhere, cessation of communication. I've been ghosted. I've never ghosted or blocked anyone. There are people I stopped talking to, but never blocked their communiques or refused to speak with them EVER EVER again.Ghosting and boycotting are two different things. Let's not redefine terms to suit our liking, m'kay..."
