knowingtheautist,Male,"Autistic individuals are especially vulnerable to falling prey to the wrong type of narcissistic partner. Some narcissistic behaviors include:- Sense of entitlement (e.g. 'What about me?' or 'I set the rules, not you' or 'Women/men should not drive'- Love-bombing (e.g. Constantly telling you 'I love you' 10x per day, telling you charming promises that are too good to be true, or wanting to move into your house or appartment 2 weeks after you meet them- Constantly admiring themselves, their success, their bodies, or looking at themselves in the mirror often- Making excuses that don't add up- Constantly putting you down- Aggressive, violent, or quick-temperedIn contrast, autistic individuals are on the extremely opposite:- Gullible, naive, or easily tricked- Too nice in order to 'make the dating work' (e.g. will buy a cell phone plan for a partner he/she just met)- Moves too fast or shows desparation- Trusts strangers too easilyFor those tips and other dating tips, I recommend the video '4 Dating Tips that WORK for ASD Individuals' on YouTube

TwilightPrincess,Female,"I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist. He had all of the traits listed above.He would gradually behave worse and worse until he did something especially awful. Then he would apologize for it and act like he loved me afterwards, and the cycle would continue. I’d believe that he’d really change this time. Of course, that never happened. He was just trying to manipulate me, and I was easy to manipulate.

It's not always easy to spot early on, because they can hide bad behavior until they know you are hooked. The NPD individual who I dated didn't love himself, though, he was horribly insecure. NPD folks may share a lot of personal information early on to create a false sense of intimacy. They may also speak poorly about people from their past and lose contact with many past friends.

Things didn't start to get bad until I was six months into the relationship, but it went from 0 to 100. There were signs before then, but I didn't really see them. I was at a really low point of my life.

Mona Pereth,Female,"Luckily I've never gotten into an intimate relationship with a highly narcissistic person.I attribute my good fortune in this regard to the fact that I regard shared interests and deep philosophical conversation as a sine qua non. For me, it's important to be able to have in-depth conversations about shared interests -- whereas, if I understand correctly, narcissists tend to form relationships based on mutual flattery. For me, too much flattery or ""love-bombing,"" in the absence of any focus on shared interests or shared intellectual exploration, has always been a turnoff.

The one is a trait, the other is a personality disorder. Needing more effort to shift beyond one's own perspective and behaviours and coping mechanisms that result from it often get misread as indicators of the other type. That said, possessing that trait and not having any insight that one possesses it might contribute to the development of the personality disorder.Some of the traits you describe of autistic romantic patterns are also typical of people engaging in love-bombing (too fast, too trusting, too intense, desperate). One of the bigger differences between ADHD/autistic love-bombing and the manipulative type is intent. The former is more a reflection of being unable to inhibit fixation, the latter is done intentionally to imitate the former and works especially well on people prone to the sincere form, after all, it resembles authentic attachment in the way they'd like it to be expressed.That said, it's not as though the circles don't touch if you were to Venn diagram them. Knowing someone has autism isn't a guarantee they won't have a personality disorder, or that they won't be be manipulative, abusive, etc

Its the fake behaviors they use to attract people (love-bombing, etc) that repel me. The weird thing I have observed it it seems to shake their bravado when rather that making themselves attractive, its repellant. The either get angry really quick or write me off and find another target.

I'm probably not making sense, but If Narcissistic Wooing behaviors were genuine, that would be a turn off for me I don't like being the focal point or in that person's spotlight.

I repel them as much as they repel me. It all works out for the best!
