chris1989,Male,"Seeing people younger than me perhaps in their early 20s, going out partying, travelling and so on, makes me feel sometimes like I have ''wasted life'' or not ''living life'' when you are young like I feel they do, by not doing that then despite the fact that I wasn't thinking of travelling then at that time. Also as I have explained before I was never a fan of the club scene or was into the drinking culture and so on even though I have drunken alcohol at parties, pubs or family gatherings responsibly. There was an uni trip to Amsterdam but I declined to go with the rest of the class. I didn't go there until I was 25 while on a two day cruise to there and Antwerp with my dad and stepmum. As I may have said before, I find myself sometimes comparing to other ''neurotypical'' people who go out, socialise, drink and party perhaps more than people like us while at the same time, knowing full well that the reason I'm not one of those ''neurotypical'' people is because I am on the Autistic spectrum and there are some struggles I maybe have which those people haven't and that's maybe why they are progressing through certain stages or milestones in life or have a more social life because they maybe don't have those same issues as I have.",0.896

Latimeria,Female,"Short version is that people do these things because they find them enjoyable, so you are only missing out if you also would find (or would have found) them enjoyable. But also, living life shouldn't be seen as synonymous with drug induced mental states.Traveling can be fun. Lots of people have not seen much of their natal town or the surrounding region since they find the idea of their local less exciting. Travel has a financial and environmental burden, so feel free to skip it if it's not a good fit for your priorities. There are many things people miss by chasing novel experiences.",0.8592
enz,Male,"The clocks ticking till we die, might as well do stuff you enjoy. No, comparing yourself to other people and acquiring what they have won't make you happy",-0.3814
JamesW,Male,You got to see Amsterdam. Your classmates most definitely did not.,0.4576
BTDT,Female,"I've discovered that day trips, if properly planned, can be just as interesting and fun as longer trips.If you want to study other cultures, there are often indigenous cultures hidden away where you live!There may be museums you can visit not far from where you live.Two ways of finding good food. Look for reviews on the Internet.Cruising a town and seeing a busy parking lot for a restaurant.The wait is usually worth it. What else are you going to be doing that evening anyway?",0.8858
jennrowland,Female,"Of course, there is no need to do it. We all like different things in life, and for each of us, ""to live a life"" means something different. I like to travel, see new things, exploring cultures, and it's a part of my process of ""living life.""Sometimes I can go out to a club, but it's not as fun as it used to be.Just do what you like, what makes you feel good, and it's not the best to compare with others.",-0.0271
Edna3362,Female,"No.That's a really exhausting and expensive lifestyle to maintain. No thanks.And I'm not even a true introvert.Oh, and...The idea of having a life of a party could just be one of those mass and common ways to cope and desensitize with existing in this current world.So what if that's not your coping mechanism? If the party does is to bring you nothing but anxiety and pain, what is the point of attending such event other than the obligation and the illusion of 'normal'?Or godforbid, boring.So what if that's not the poison of your choice? And just this idea that 'everyone likes this, you don't, therefore I ain't fit to be human'?? Lol. No.The ability to waste your years in a party is not 'progress'; it's the ability to know if that's what you need in life; and definately when one doesn't need the idea around the life of a party to feel truly alive (unless a life of a party IS their calling, and not as a coping mechanism/escape).

Brian0787,Male,"No but I completely understand why you feel that way. You see other young people living their life and having fun and you think why can't that be me. It's easy to compare yourself and I've done it numerous times. If you do that though you can feel down. Sometimes it's good to get away from the crowd and walk a different path. I never could tolerate parties because of the noise, people everywhere and it just overstimulates me to the point that I can't stand it. I have to be to the sides. It's ok to be different but it's also understandable that you wish for those experiences too.

autisticelders,Female,"thousands of other ways to live a very good life. society and advertising/ marketing etc try to make us think if we only drink the right beverage, drive the right car, wear the right clothing, etc our lives will be fulfilled. Not everybody ""buys"" that. There are so many other things that are likely healthier and less expensive, with more rewarding and fulfilling results ""out there"" to be explored. ( you knew that anyways, didn't you? )

ShwaggyD,Male,"I tried the party scene a little bit in college, it was a hilarious disaster every time. I was always the person sitting in the corner holding the same barely touched wine cooler all night. I wouldn't talk to anyone unless absolutely necessary and felt completely uncomfortable every time I would go. I could usually make it 2-4 hours before I had to escape sneakily out the closest exit, and usually walk across town to my apartment. The party scene is definitely not for me.I've travelled to several places within the US and abroad for work and vacation and really enjoyed the experience each time. I like travelling with others but really enjoy exploring by myself a lot more. I travelled to Jamaica once with a friend. She slept on beach all day and I explored, best vacation ever for both of us.Don't think you have to do anything special to live life, just find the things that make you happy and figure out how to make that a special part of your life.",0.9875
