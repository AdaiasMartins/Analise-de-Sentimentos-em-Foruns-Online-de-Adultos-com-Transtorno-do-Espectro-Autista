catpiecakebutter,Female,"I'm unhappy with when I try to make a friend and things don't work well. I think I might give up on the whole thing even though a online friend of mine said ""I should put myself out there."" I know I can't handle it.",0.4188
autisticelders,Female,"I don't have local friends but I do have friends I made online by joining an interest group. After interacting on line for a while, some of us have met to do interest related things together a few times a year. I got along with some members, but not all. Now I can meet up with a few people off and on to do interest related things. I don't go to meetings and usually there are only one or 2 of us, we mostly talk about interest related stuff. that seems to be enough for me. Listen to yourself, and find what you need. Just because somebody else says you should do something doesn't mean it is right for you. You get to choose how to do your own life.

RichardMcF,Male,"I can make a good effort to make friends, but only at a superficial level. More passing acquaintances. That's because I've learnt to ask new people about themselves, but my limited rapport only extends to an initial chat.I think I struggle to make meaningful friendships because I find time spent discussing 'nothing' to be a poor use of my time.I am extremely fortunate that my wife has stuck with me for 30 years, 27 married, so she has become my best friend and confident. That said, she would love me to have friends so I could tell them about making homemade Kefir and Greek yoghurt instead of her.",0.9846
Latimeria,Female,"I've mostly given up on interacting with people outside formal settings. With the exception of other autistic people, we communicate and think about things too distinctly. I have decades of living on a separate track from most of society and the gap in understanding only grows with time. There is also the issue of the fact that I won't experience 'life stages.' The idea is that everyone is moving through some set path: something like early career, late career while married pair with kids, followed by retirement. Most use the concept these life stages to build a sense of common ground with each other. I only experienced the ones related with childhood, a period where I was ostracized. Now I'm no longer a child, but also not an 'adult' in the way society recognizes.I do okay in organized environments like volunteer work or religious communities where there is a defined activity and a way of interacting with each other. I've thought about attending a reoccurring local board game gathering . I think I would do okay there as well, but that brings me to another challenge, my limited social energy.My sparse romantic relationships have not gone that well, but that has more to do with my past insecurities following my childhood ostracization and inability to make friends as an adult. For whatever reason, I otherwise found romantic relationships easier to maintain. I suspect it would go better now that I've learned, without relying on distractions, to be more emotionally self sufficient and to feel less alone. Reducing the need for companionship may be somewhat novel and, in fact, I only achieved it unintentionally while focused on a different pursuit. However, the romantic partner would no longer have to try to fill the gap others fill with an entire friend group.",0.9806

What are your hobbies/interests? Have you ever looked (e.g. via Meetup.com or on social media) for groups of people who share your hobbies/interests?RichardMcF wrote:I am extremely fortunate that my wife has stuck with me for 30 years, 27 married, so she has become my best friend and confident.

shortfatbalduglyman,Male,"in some situations, some activities, not worth the cost benefit analysis.risk vs rewardyour friends (or anyone else) might think they know what's best for you, but every situation is different. your friend can't feel your emotions or anything like that. peer pressureonly a couple of my precious ""friends"", were worth the time, energy and money it took to interact with them.all, or almost all, of my previous precious lil ""friends"", grotesquely overestimated their importance, intelligence, wisdom, and et cetera.",0.994
