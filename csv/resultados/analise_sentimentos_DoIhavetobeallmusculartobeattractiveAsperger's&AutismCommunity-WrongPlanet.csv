chris1989,Male,I'm tall and quite thin. I do use some weights at home on occasions. I think the muscle in my arms has bulged a little probably because of that. But I still don't feel that very interested enough to go and join a gym. I personally wouldn't want to look like some body builder with big muscles but I can't help but think that that is what a lot of men are doing now and I feel like the only one who isn't very interested and passionate on these activities. I do hear women say that it can be a turn off if all a man does is always go to the gym and talks about it and their muscles rather than focusing on having time with them. But I can't help that there are still a number of women out there who do like their men all muscular and so on.,0.9283
TwilightPrincess,Female,"Women have a wide variety of tastes and preferences. No person will be attractive to all women. Personally speaking, I might feel a bit intimidated around someone who looked like a body builder. Apart from that, I don’t really have much of a preference. I dated a couple guys who were a bit muscular and a couple who weren’t at all. It’s not something I care about or look for.My answer to the question in the title: No.

Benjamin the Donkey,Male,"My teenage son is very thin (too skinny to my eyes), but some girls are definitely attracted to him.For myself, I try to stay fit, but I've never had a desire for big muscles, and I've probably done better than most in regards to female attention.But tastes differ, for women as well as men.

nick007,Male,"My girlfriend finds chubby guys more physically attractive than muscular guys & she imagines that chubby guys are betterfor cuddling but to be fair she's always been overweight herself.

BillyTree,Male,"To be attractive be the person you want to be. Some women (or gay men) are attracted to certain traits like big muscles, thin waistlines, tall height, a straight nose or whatever. Other women (or gay men) are attracted to the opposite traits. Pretty much everybody is attracted to people that are themselves and make no excuses about it.

OrangeCloud2,Male,"I've gotten quite muscular in the last 2 years and women do seem more interested in me than they were before, but like a lot of autistics I don't have any fashion sense and people don't notice my physique.And NT's don't pay the same attention to detail as us in general so unless I walk around with no top on or wear fashionable clothes that being it out no-one has a clue.",0.5862
BillyTree,Male,"OrangeCloud2 wrote:like a lot of autistics I don't have any fashion senseIn my experience autistics have as much fashion sense as people in general. There are autistics that wear ridiculus outfits while some have an exellent taste in clothes and look great, and the same goes for allistic people.

BillyTree,Male,"^I think Steve Jobs dressed in a style that fitted him without flimsily jumping along with every fashion trend.

OrangeCloud2,Male,I'm not actually sure if Steve Jobs was Autistic. He clearly had some traits but I don't think he's been diagnosed or anything.,0.0948

But I can't help that there are still a number of women out there who do like their men all muscular and so on.But working out and getting fit is a good idea whether women find it attractive or not. It has so many health benefits, lower blood pressure, lower resting heart rate, stronger muscles, higher testosterone levels etc.But going to the gym and lifting weights up and down bores the hell out of me as well. And all you are doing is getting better at lifting a weight up and down which isn't a useful skill.I prefer functional training, I like to swim, run, climb, and do martial arts. This way you are doing stuff that's more interesting and you are learning useful functional skills as well as getting fit.",0.9913
